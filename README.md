# Stochastic GFlowNets for Kidney Exchange Programs: A Critical Extension

## Overview

By integrating Stochastic GFlowNets (Pan et al., 2023), we address inherent limitations in deterministic flow models under Markovian transitions in KEP, demonstrating through mathematical dissection how unmodeled stochasticity biases marginals, fairness metrics, and long-term expectations. The goal is to foster rigorous probabilistic fidelity in high-stakes combinatorial optimization, where approximations must confront the full entropy of real-world dynamics.

## Purpose and Contributions

- **Mathematical Analysis**: We formalize the divergence arising from deterministic assumptions in stochastic environments, proving non-zero Kullback-Leibler gaps that inflate variance and collapse modes.
- **Simulation Framework**: Conceptual tools to replicate biases in toy KEPs, highlighting cascades in expected transplants and pool composition.
- **Ethical Imperative**: In KEPs, where each transplant equates to substantial quality-adjusted life years (valued at >$5M per case in health economics), unaddressed biases represent a quantifiable inefficiency. This repo advocates for stochastic integration to align models with probabilistic reality.

No executable code is included; simulations are conceptual and can be implemented via standard libraries (e.g., NumPy for Monte-Carlo runs). For replication, refer to the mathematical sections below.

## Mathematical Dissection: Fracturing the Flow Lattice

Standard GFlowNets enforce equilibrium under determinism: for trajectory $\tau = (s_0 \to \dots \to s_n = x)$, trajectory balance (TB) mandates

$$
Z \prod_{i=1}^{n} P_F(s_i \mid s_{i-1}) = R(x) \prod_{i=1}^{n} P_B(s_{i-1} \mid s_i),
$$

ensuring marginals $P_T(x) = \sum_{\tau \to x} P_F(\tau) \propto R(x)$, with $Z$ the partition scalar. Detailed balance (DB) localizes: $F(s) P_F(s' \mid s) = F(s') P_B(s \mid s')$, where $F(s) = \sum_{\tau \ni s} F(\tau)$.

In KEPs, external $G' \sim M(G, H)$—Poisson arrivals ($\lambda=5$), Bernoulli compatibilities—branches stochastically, yielding $|\{G' \mid P(G' \mid (G, H)) > 0\}| > 1$. Assumption $T(s, a) = s'$ fractures: marginals $P_T(H) \propto R(H)$ local, oblivious to $\mathbb{E}[\sum_t R_t \mid \pi, M]$.

Flow inconsistency: Forward marginal $P_T(H) = \int P_F(\tau_H) d\tau_H$ (intra-round deterministic). Post, $s' = (G', \emptyset) \sim M$ disperses downstream $R_{t+1}$, yet upstream $P_F$ blind. True target: $P^*(\tau) \propto \prod_t R(H_t) \prod_t P(s_{t+1} \mid (s_t, H_t))$; standard optimizes $\prod_t R(H_t)$, Kullback-Leibler

$D_{KL}(P^* || P_T) = E_{P^*}[log P(s_{t+1} | (s_t, H_t))] > 0$


unless $P = \delta$ (deterministic)—impossible. Gap swells with branching: entropy $\mathbb{H}[P(\cdot \mid (s, H))]$ biases toward low-entropy greed.

Gradient variance: TB $\nabla L_{TB} \sim \sum_i \nabla \log P_F \cdot (\log Z + \sum \log P_F - \log R - \sum \log P_B)$; unmodeled $P$ injects noise, $\mathrm{Var}[\nabla L] = O(n \cdot b)$ ($n$=rounds, $b$=branches)—unstable, modes collapse (Pan Figs. 5-9). Limit $\alpha \to 1$ (uniform $P$): $P_T(H) \to$ uniform, erasing $R$—optimal ignores transplants.

Stochastic rectifies: even-odd decomposition,

$$F(s) \pi(a \mid s) P(s' \mid (s, a)) = F(s') \pi_B((s, a) \mid s')$$


loss with $\hat{P} \approx M$ via MLE. Bias dissolves: $\log P$ aligns $P_T \to P^*$, $D_{KL} \to 0$.

Toy: Static $P_T(H_2)/P_T(H_1) = e^{-1} \approx 0.37$; true $\mathbb{E}[\sum \mid H_2] > \mathbb{E}[\sum \mid H_1]$. Iterate: greed traps low-entropy, variance $\to \infty$—lattice crumbles.

## Experiment: Demonstrating Collapse in Stochastic Environments (v1)

To illustrate the problem highlighted in the mathematical analysis, I've added a preliminary experiment inspired by the stochastic chain environment from Pan et al. (2023). This serves as a proof-of-concept to show how standard GFlowNets falter in stochastic settings, while the stochastic variant holds up. It's a simple chain where you start at state 0 and can either "stop" (terminate with reward at current state) or "continue" (move forward with probability p=0.5 or stay put with 0.5). The reward function is bimodal, with peaks around N/4 and 3N/4, making it a good test for capturing multiple modes without collapse.

In this env, the standard GFlowNet treats transitions as deterministic, ignoring the probabilistic branching. As N (chain length) grows, unmodeled stochasticity injects noise into the gradients, leading to higher variance, biased marginals, and eventual mode collapse— the model favors low-entropy paths, missing the true distribution. You see the KL divergence (measuring how far the sampled distribution is from the true posterior) spike for the standard version, while the stochastic one, which explicitly includes P(s' | s, a) in the balance, keeps the divergence low and stable.

This is just v1—a quick iteration to get the ball rolling and validate the critique. I'm building this iteratively, in the spirit of fail-fast-and-iterate: prototype, test, refine, push. It's how we move at speed in a world that's not slowing down—think Musk vs. the inertia of traditional research, where velocity can be intimidating but necessary for progress. No arrogance here, just the drive to expose flaws and fix them before they cost lives in applications like KEPs. For now, this Pan-inspired toy shows why stochasticity breaks the standard approach; I'm finalizing the full KEP simulation on my local machine (with Poisson arrivals, compatibility graphs, etc.) and will push updates in the coming hours or days. Expect polished proofs, more experiments, and iterative improvements as we die and retry to get it right.

Running the code below generate the plots. Here's the performance comparison (KL divergence vs. environment size):

The env is highly stochastic

In the plot, the blue line (standard) climbs sharply as N increases, showing the collapse, while orange (stochastic) rises gently, staying closer to the truth.
